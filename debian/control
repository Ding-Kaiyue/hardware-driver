Description: Hardware driver library for motor control (development files)
 This package provides the development files for the hardware driver library,
 which offers a simple API for controlling motors via CAN interfaces.
 .
 The library supports:
  - Velocity, position, and effort control modes
  - MIT mode (position + velocity + effort)
  - Real-time motor status monitoring
  - Multi-threaded feedback processing
 .
 This package contains the header files and development libraries needed
 to compile programs that use the hardware driver library.

Description: Hardware driver library for motor control (runtime)
 This package provides the runtime library for the hardware driver library,
 which offers a simple API for controlling motors via CAN interfaces.
 .
 The library supports:
  - Velocity, position, and effort control modes
  - MIT mode (position + velocity + effort)
  - Real-time motor status monitoring
  - Multi-threaded feedback processing
 .
 This package contains the shared library needed to run programs that use
 the hardware driver library.
